# Getting started 

Please make sure you have newest version of **Neovim** (>= 0.5). \
You can visit [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) for instructions regarding installation.

You also need to install [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) which is used for installing plugins created by **Neovim** community.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```

Since we use [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim), there are certain packages that are optional to install but they give a great experience.

* [sharkdp/bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - File previews  
* [sharkdp/fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) - Better alternative to find
* [BurntSushi/ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - Better alternative to grep
