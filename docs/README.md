# Introduction 

> Neovim configuration with good defaults written in Lua.

## Motivation
**YoNeo** is basically a neovim configuration written in Lua.

This configuration basically helps in implementing features which I liked in **Visual Studio Code** and **Doom Emacs**.
**Visual Studio Code** is a good code editor but modal editing is what I prefer. 
**Doom Emacs** is one of the best experiences I had because it is preconfigured and had sane keybindings.

**Doom Emacs** also had great plugins ranging from projectile, magit, dired and one of the most loved feature called org-mode.
In spite of such a great Out of the Box experience, it's autocompletion was very slow which I was unable to solve.

So, what I wanted was the experience of **Doom Emacs** in **Neovim** and this was how everything started.
